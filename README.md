This project analyzes Learnova’s prospect data to identify the factors most strongly influencing online course enrollment and to guide more efficient outreach strategies. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, I evaluated demographic, behavioral, and marketing features such as age, occupation, profile completion, site engagement, and referral sources. I then developed and assessed classification models—including logistic regression, random forest, and boosted trees—using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to balance accuracy with actionable business use. The results highlight profile completion, engagement depth, and referral quality as the most important drivers of enrollment. Based on these insights, I proposed targeted strategies such as predictive lead scoring, occupation-based marketing, and referral programs to improve conversion rates and optimize Learnova’s resource allocation
